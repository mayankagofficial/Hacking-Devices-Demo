## Introduction

The USBNinja is a highly covert USB exploit framework allowing for wireless remote triggering of custom payloads.

While dormant, the USBNinja functions as a regular USB device: Data Transfer, Recharging, etc. However, when triggered (via smartphone or dedicated long-range antenna) â€“ it executes its preprogrammed payload on the host device.

Emulating keyboard and mouse actions, payloads are completely customizable and can be highly targeted.

Undetectable by firewalls, AV software, or visual inspection, the USBNinja is an ideal tool for penetration testers, police, and government.
